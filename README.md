# INVERTED-SEARCH
An inverted index maps content (words or numbers) to their locations in a database, document, or set of documents. It enables fast full-text searches, though it increases processing when adding documents. Commonly used in search engines and document retrieval systems, this project aims to implement an inverted search using hash algorithms.
